				I am a junior at <a href="https://stanford.edu" target="_blank">Stanford University </a> pursuing a Computer Science Major with a concentration in Artificial Intelligence. I am interested in AI, Mobile App Development, and HCI. I am a Section Leader for <a href="https://cs106b.stanford.edu" target="_blank">CS106B</a>.

				I'm passionate about creating new technology and systems that help redefine the lives of people on a large scale. Even though computers have grown increasingly familiar to me over the years, they still continue to carry the same level of fascination for me as when I first began my explorations at the age of 10.  
				<br>
				<br> I love working in collaborative environments outside the classroom. One of my favorite activities is attending hackathons, since that gives me a platform to work at the intersection of two of my passions - innovation and collaboration.
				<br>
				<br> I enjoy taking up positions of leadership. I was the founder of 2 clubs and the president of 3 clubs in high school. I was also the Head Boy of my high school senate.

					<br> I worked as a backend engineer on the IMDb platform, on the Consumer Reference team. I created production-ready video ingestion service from scratch, which brought down the time to upload a video to the IMDb platform from several minutes to a few seconds.

					My first industry internship came with a lot of new experiences. From learning how to design software infrastructure to deploying code to beta for the first time, I thoroughly my time at Amazon.

					<br>
					<br> I teach a weekly discussion section to solidify concepts taught in lecture and work through programming problems. I hold office hours, where I am responsible for answering questions and helping students debug their code. I also held workshops and assisted new Section Leaders through practice teaches.

					<br> I worked on a project known as Facilitating Affect Regulation in children diagnosed with ASD, or FAR.
					<br>
					<br> I developed an end-to-end haptic breathing pacer for children diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) using Swift and Arduino. I built an iOS app from scratch to manage the device and implemented bluetooth communication protocols between the app and the microprocessor on the device.

					<br> Stanford was my dream school ever since I was 13. When I got here, it was everything I had imagined.
					<br>
					<br> The scale and diversity of opportunities at Stanford were unprecedented, and they pushed to expand my perspective and challenge myself to the fullest.
					<br>
					<br> I am a member of Applied Cybersecurity and was previously the Webmaster of Stanford SSI.
					<br>
					<br> Being in the presence of such remarkable peers and inspiring people, everyday at Stanford feels like a dream.

						<br> YesTrashCan is a modular CV project that classifies user waste and helps monitor waste levels on a centralized dashboard and make sustainability effortless. We used the nVidia Jetson Nano to run a CV model to classify waste.

						<br> At some point during the pandemic, scheduling utilities lost their appeal. Most were hard to use on phones, and thus I created WhatTimeWorks, a real-time organization application that helps you get availabilities and schedule events when a large number of people are involved.
