			<div id="about-content"> 
				I am a High School Student at <a href="https://dpsrohini.com/" target="_blank">DPS Rohini </a> studying subjects of Physics, Chemistry, Math, English & Computer Science. I have a strong background in Computer Science, which allows me to merge my love for logic and problem-solving with the digital world. From coding complex algorithms to creating innovative software solutions, I'm continually fascinated by the ever-evolving tech landscape. 
				<br>
				<br> I'm a Scrabble enthusiast with an insatiable passion for words. Whether I'm placing tiles on a game board or crafting sentences in everyday life, I find immense joy in the intricacies of language. In my world, a well-played Scrabble word is a work of art.
				<br>
				<br> Beyond my love for words--numbers, equations, and  puzzles are my idea of a good time. I'm always up for a challenging crossword or a lively discussion about the beauty of mathematical concepts. 
				<br>
				<br> When I'm not engrossed in words, numbers, or code, you'll often find me engaging in sports. Whether it's a casual game of cricket with friends or a serious bout of football (or soccer if you may), sports play an essential role in keeping me active and energized.
				<br>
				<br> Lastly, I'm a believer in the power of positivity, kindness, and the potential for growth in every individual. I strive to approach life with an open heart and an open mind, constantly seeking to learn and evolve. Someone who believes in the power of optimism and personal growth.

Additionally I networked with IT experts to come to our school.

						I developed a specialized mobile application designed to enhance the word construction skills of Scrabble players in preparation for tournament-level competition.

						I conducted in-depth research into the effects of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the world of Scrabble. My exploration covered key algorithms like DAWG and GADDAG, as well as the use of AI tools such as Maven and Quackle. I further delved into the performance of human players vs AI opponents, using data from the BasicBot on Woogles. This research sheds light on the evolving landscape of Scrabble and other games with incomplete information in the age of AI.
